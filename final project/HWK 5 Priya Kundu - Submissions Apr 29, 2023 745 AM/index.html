<p>Hello Professor,</p>
<p>The assignment was to execute code from 3pm to 6am but while executing, we faced "ConnectionError" multiple times, hence it took us some time to debug the code and we had to push our interval 1 execution by 1.5 hours and hence, the timing for the first execution is different from the mentioned time frame. But we have made sure to keep the rest of the interval timings same as asked in the assignment 5.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the last interval, due to abrupt disconnection of network at our residence, we couldn't execute the last 30 minutes. But, looking at the trend the execution followed, we did regression using the data we gathered before the connection terminated.</p>
<p>Please take these unavoidable glitches into consideration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks and regards,</p>
